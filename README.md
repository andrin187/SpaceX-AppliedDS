# üöÄ SpaceX-AppliedDS
This project follows the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project with the purpose of practicing Data Science methodologies and techniques. 

## üí°Background
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## ‚ùóObjective 

In this project I want to answer the following questions:
- What variables have an impact on the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing?
- Which machine learning model has the highest accuracy in predicting the outcome of a Falcon 9 first stage landing?
- Will future landings be successful?
